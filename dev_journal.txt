I have just read the theme for the jam, which is Bug! I feel like I have seen a
lot of "Intentional glitch" themed games recently, so I want to avoid that. I'm
also new to this and too worried about unintentional glitches to confidently
use that theme.

But they have also invited people to interpret Bug! in whatever way works best,
to include inventing an acronym. So here's some thoughts:

-Lead a colony of bugs to food with pheromone trails.
-Give players bad solutions to puzzles to debug.
-Agitate a character until they fail a task.
-An idle mosquito slapper?
-Back Up Generator. Repair the generator before you freeze.
-Beyond Unknown Galaxies. Space exploration?
-Beetle-drawn chariot racing game with fun, slide-y physics.

My initial thoughts are that I loved Sim Ant as a kid so the insect ideas are
attractive to me. Another consideration is that the assets need to be public, or
made by me. An insect theme could use a bunch of each to draw sprites, so that's
another mark in favor of that approach. Maybe I can combine a few?

I'm also thinking about my development environment now. I joined this to learn
Godot and with a whole month I should be able too. But I'm also getting a little
case of cold feet. I'm pretty familiar with Python, and if I stay with Pygame
I'm confident that I could add some pretty cool AI to my bugs. I don't know if
I'm going to be able to do that in Godot. Probably yes...

With 30 days to work, I think the best idea is to sleep of the theme for
tonight.
