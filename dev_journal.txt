I have just read the theme for the jam, which is Bug! I feel like I have seen a
lot of "Intentional glitch" themed games recently, so I want to avoid that. I'm
also new to this and too worried about unintentional glitches to confidently
use that theme.

But they have also invited people to interpret Bug! in whatever way works best,
to include inventing an acronym. So here's some thoughts:

-Lead a colony of bugs to food with pheromone trails.
-Give players bad solutions to puzzles to debug.
-Agitate a character until they fail a task.
-An idle mosquito slapper?
-Back Up Generator. Repair the generator before you freeze.
-Beyond Unknown Galaxies. Space exploration?
-Beetle-drawn chariot racing game with fun, slide-y physics.
-A disease spreading? Maybe too on the nose.

My initial thoughts are that I loved Sim Ant as a kid so the insect ideas are
attractive to me. Another consideration is that the assets need to be public, or
made by me. An insect theme could use a bunch of each to draw sprites, so that's
another mark in favor of that approach. Maybe I can combine a few?

I'm also thinking about my development environment now. I joined this to learn
Godot and with a whole month I should be able too. But I'm also getting a little
case of cold feet. I'm pretty familiar with Python, and if I stay with Pygame
I'm confident that I could add some pretty cool AI to my bugs. I don't know if
I'm going to be able to do that in Godot. Probably yes...

With 30 days to work, I think the best idea is to sleep of the theme for
tonight.

Bug out!

# Nov 2 #
I remembered the phrase "bug out" yesterday evening and really like it as a
setup for a game. The user will have some limited time period to collect as
many useful items as possible in a short time limit. Their score is the sum of
the items that they collect in the time period if they reach their bunker, or
zero if they explode.

I really like the idea of running with "Bug Out", but I'll have to thematically
distinguish this game from several other "collect stuff and go to bunker" games
that have been popular over the last couple of years. "Bug out" is usually used
to mean leaving an area, so maybe this is a "grab stuff and flee" game rather
than a "grab stuff and shelter" game. I can also drag in one or two of the other
theme concepts. Maybe a bug is fleeing an exterminator or a player has five
minutes to collect tool, and then has to fix a generator with whatever they
grabbed.

So, concept is moving in the right direction. I also had an idea for the
gameplay and I don't know yet if it's a terrible idea or not. I'm thinking about
making a text-based game. Maybe a few graphics, but almost entirely text.
Writing a text parser can be a bunch of work but I'm pretty confident with this
class of problem I think I can steal some old code from a compilers class. Plus,
it always good to brush up on regex a little. So here's the arguments in favor
or a text game:
  -I think the game will stand out from the other 6000 entries in the Game Off.
   Maybe not in a good way, but we should be one of very few text entries.
  -Since I can't use paid assets, I'm expecting to have to draw a lot of the
   artwork myself (or find public assets). I have very little confidence in my
   ability to draw, but a lot of confidence in my ability to write and code. A
   text based game actually seems like a good way to play to my strengths.
